==== TO DO ===
1. Create rendering pipeline and rework some of the rendering steps

2. Might need to create a material registry which the renderer can use. This would allow you to register
   materials to be reused by the render then the "RenderableObject" will just contain an ID to the material

3. Rendering pipeline should have a queue of all the renderable objects then group by material ID each frame
