Rendering Pipeline?

1. User Registers Shader with Engine.createShader() returns u_int32 ID
2. User Registers Texture with Engine.createTexture() returns u_int32 ID
3. User can create Material which will take in a Shader ID and a Texture ID
   1. Materials will also have uniforms for the shaders in its use method.
4. User can create a "Renderable" with a Mesh and a Material
5. Users can directly add Renderables to the renderer (possibly handled in some other process later) with
   addRenderable()
6. In the renderer, each frame, we check the list of renderables and load in the texture and shader and create
   a new vector for loaded textures and shaders.
   1. Only load textures and shaders IF they are not in our vector array. Otherwise load the shader and texture and add to vector arrays.
7. Organize the renderables into a queue ordered by the Texture ID
8. Render each renderable and apply materials
